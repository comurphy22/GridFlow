# POST-DISASTER ACTION PLAN

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Hour 0-6)

1. **Recommendation**: Deploy mobile command centers to high-density outage zones identified in simulation (coordinates 400-470, 50-90)
- **Justification**: Simulation shows worst delays (1800-2000 min) cluster in this region; centralized command reduces travel variance
- **Predicted Impact**: 20-30% reduction in worst-case delays (based on p90 delta of 272 min)
- **Owner**: Regional Operations Manager
- **Success Metric**: Average response time within command center radius

2. **Recommendation**: Implement "scout-and-report" protocol - dedicated assessment teams report outages to central dispatch before repair crews deploy
- **Justification**: Data shows 5-8x more stops in real vs. optimal routes; indicates poor initial intelligence
- **Predicted Impact**: 40% reduction in unnecessary crew redirects
- **Owner**: Dispatch Supervisor
- **Success Metric**: Ratio of planned vs. actual stops per crew

### SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (Day 1-7)

1. **Recommendation**: Establish dynamic replan triggers based on discovered outage density
- **Justification**: Critical cases show 50+ actual stops vs. 6-11 optimal stops
- **Predicted Impact**: 25% reduction in median delay (from 7.89 to ~5.9 minutes)
- **Owner**: Analytics Team
- **Success Metric**: Deviation from optimal route time

2. **Recommendation**: Implement zone-based crew assignments with 15-mile maximum radius
- **Justification**: Mean Euclidean distance of 259 units suggests excessive travel between repairs
- **Predicted Impact**: 30% reduction in inter-repair travel time
- **Owner**: Resource Manager
- **Success Metric**: Average distance between consecutive repairs

3. **Recommendation**: Deploy mobile material staging units to coordinates (230,164) and (425,52)
- **Justification**: Critical cases show major delays between these points
- **Predicted Impact**: 35% reduction in material retrieval time
- **Owner**: Logistics Manager
- **Success Metric**: Time from repair identification to material availability

### OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS (Week 2-4)

1. **Recommendation**: Develop AI-powered routing algorithm incorporating real-time crew feedback
- **Justification**: 246-minute standard deviation in delays indicates poor route adaptation
- **Predicted Impact**: 50% reduction in route replanning time
- **Owner**: Technology Team
- **Success Metric**: Algorithm vs. human dispatcher performance

2. **Recommendation**: Establish cross-team coordination protocols based on outage density thresholds
- **Justification**: Worst cases show 4-5x optimal repair time when multiple teams operate in same area
- **Predicted Impact**: 15% improvement in crew utilization
- **Owner**: Operations Director
- **Success Metric**: Crew overlap in high-density areas

### Priority Decision Matrix

1. Critical Infrastructure (hospitals, emergency services)
   - Immediate dispatch if within 30-minute travel
   - Coordinate with emergency services for access

2. Safety Hazards
   - Deploy assessment team within 15 minutes
   - Establish 1-mile exclusion zone until assessed

3. Socially Vulnerable Areas
   - Prioritize if multiple outages have equal technical priority
   - Consider temporary power solutions

4. Standard Outages
   - Optimize for minimum travel time between repairs
   - Batch repairs by equipment type and crew expertise

### Communication Protocol

- Status updates every 30 minutes
- Immediate escalation for:
  * Crew safety issues
  * Critical infrastructure impacts
  * Repair time >150% of estimate
  * Discovery of 5+ new outages in zone

This plan addresses the simulation's key findings:
- Large variance between optimal and actual routes (mean delta 100.45 min)
- Significant travel inefficiency (mean Euclidean distance 259 units)
- Critical cases showing 5-10x optimal repair times
- Clustering of major delays in specific coordinates
